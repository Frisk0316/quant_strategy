# Current State

A small, always-current snapshot a session can trust on a cold start. Keep this
**short** and **present-tense** - it is not a changelog (history goes to
`docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md`) and not a backlog (gaps go to `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`).

This file complements `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`: `AI_HANDOFF.md` is the working
handoff between sessions; this is the one-screen "where are we" that
[[CONTEXT_BUDGET]] marks must-load.

## Snapshot

- **Current goal:** Market Data Coverage fetch queue + delete-pair implementation
  from `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-18-market-data-queue-and-delete.md` is in
  progress on `codex/impl-multi-venue-instrument-specs`. The branch also carries
  the ADR-0007 P1 multi-venue closeout context.
- **Current branch:** `codex/impl-multi-venue-instrument-specs`.
- **Last known good state:** The branch contains P1 merge commits `d649701`
  (Claude design/changelog) and `10d631f` (price chart) on top of the ADR-0007
  implementation. No existing result artifacts were modified.
- **Current working state:** Local ADR-0007 P1 closeout is implemented.
  `db_parity` reports `canonical_source_primary`, scopes canonical reads to the
  run exchange, and compares timestamped `close` only for `price_series.csv`
  provenance. A direct 2026-06-18 check of the saved Binance run matched 192/192
  artifact closes to DB canonical Binance closes with zero mismatches. Durable
  source-provenance evidence lives at
  `results/adr0007_binance_btc_1h_db_pass_20260618/validation/codex_close_only_db_parity_pass_20260618/validation_result.json`
  and passes `ct_val_provenance`, `db_parity`, and `ohlcv_source_validation`.
  Price chart panels now render progressively per selected symbol, with
  technical overlays still gated to MA/EMA/MACD. Market Data Coverage now queues
  fetch jobs sequentially in the API, renders the fetch job list in the frontend,
  and exposes a guarded whole-pair delete path for OHLCV/funding pairs.
- **Active risks:** The older checked-in validation artifact
  `adr0007_binance_btc_1h_db_pass_20260618_source_provenance` still records the
  pre-fix FAIL and now carries `SUPERSEDED.md`; cite the new
  `codex_close_only_db_parity_pass_20260618` artifact for PASS evidence. Port
  5432 repo DSN is currently reachable; local PostgreSQL on port 5433 still
  rejects the repo `quant` credentials.
- **Do-not-touch:** trading-core (`strategies/`, `signals/`, `risk/`,
  `portfolio/`, `execution/`), PnL/fee/funding behavior, DB schema, deployment
  gates, existing result artifacts, and API/frontend behavior outside the
  approved Market Data Coverage queue/delete scope.

## Next steps

- Manually smoke the Market Data Coverage queue/delete flow against a DB-backed
  server before relying on it operationally.
- Open/review one consolidated PR from `codex/impl-multi-venue-instrument-specs`
  to `main` after the active implementation branch is ready.
- Keep Binance promotion work (signal quorum + WF/CPCV) and branch-protection
  required-check configuration as separate tasks.

## How to update

Overwrite the snapshot whenever it goes stale; do not append history. Move
completed detail to `docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md` and durable gaps to
`docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.
