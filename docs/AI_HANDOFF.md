# AI Handoff

Cross-session memory for Claude and Codex. **Read this before starting any task. Update this before ending any session.**

---

## Current Goal

Begin PR14A shadow mode parity design after PR13 review/merge.

## Current Branch

`design/replay-terminal-liquidation-plan`

## Last Known Good Commit

`cb022c5` — Add TradesView, CompareView, and RiskView components  
_(Status: tests/unit pass locally; integration tests require TimescaleDB — not confirmed clean in CI)_

## System Overview

| Layer | Key files |
|---|---|
| Strategies | `src/okx_quant/strategies/` — funding_carry, pairs_trading, as_market_maker, obi_market_maker |
| Signals | `src/okx_quant/signals/` |
| Portfolio | `src/okx_quant/portfolio/` — sizing, position ledger |
| Execution | `src/okx_quant/execution/` — broker, replay_execution |
| Risk | `src/okx_quant/risk/` — risk guard, drawdown, circuit breaker |
| Backtesting | `backtesting/` — replay engine, CPCV, walk-forward, artifacts |
| API | `src/okx_quant/api/` — FastAPI server, backtest routes |
| Frontend | `frontend/` — dashboard, backtest viewer, charts |
| Data | TimescaleDB — OHLCV, funding rates, canonical candles |
| Config | `config/settings.yaml`, `config/strategies.yaml`, `config/risk.yaml` |

## Current Change Context

| Commit / PR | Change | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| PR14A `(next)` | Design shadow mode parity plan | Document SimBroker vs OKX demo comparison gap and implementation path |
| PR13 `(complete; pending review/merge)` | Implement remaining ADR-0005 replay validation gates | Gate 2 fill-rate warning, Gate 3 data coverage, Gate 4 funding coverage implemented; ADR-0005 moved to Accepted |
| PR12B | Implement replay terminal liquidation | Gate 1 terminal position check implemented via `validation["terminal_positions_closed"]`; replay default closes terminal positions; CLI can opt out; focused regression tests added |
| PR12A | Add replay terminal liquidation design plan | Docs-only design; no replay behavior change |
| PR11 | Add funding carry dual-leg regression tests for signal metadata and PM order alignment | Test-only coverage for long spot + short perp carry behavior |
| PR10B | Add pairs exit/stop hedge close metadata and remove hedge metadata xfail | Strategy metadata only; sizing remains unchanged |
| PR10 | Add pairs trading hedge-close regression coverage | Test-only coverage for linked hedge close behavior |
| PR9 | Add backtest artifact schema regression tests for ADR-0002 frozen fields | Test-only coverage for artifact contract |
| PR8 | Add frontend MIME smoke tests for `.js` and legacy `.jsx` ES modules | Test-only coverage for FastAPI StaticFiles MIME behavior |
| PR7 | Add branch/version management policy and PR template checklist | Governance docs only |

## Known Bugs / Open Issues

1. **Shadow mode mismatch** (P0): `scripts/run_shadow.py` claims SimBroker vs OKX demo comparison, but engine only instantiates SimBroker in shadow mode. No true comparison happens.
2. **SimBroker fill event gap** (P0): `ExecutionHandler.on_order()` expects WebSocket fill, but `SimBroker.submit()` does not emit a simulated fill event — blocks unified backtest/live engine path.
3. **Replay bar-level approximation** (P1): `scripts/run_backtest.py` uses per-bar approximation formulas, not the true `Strategy → Signal → Order → Fill → Ledger` path.
4. **CI gate is minimal**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs ruff fatal-only baseline and unit tests only. This is a temporary baseline until existing lint debt is cleaned up; integration tests still require TimescaleDB planning.
5. **Missing regression tests**:
   - Frontend MIME smoke test exists.
   - Backtest artifact schema regression test exists.
   - Pairs trading hedge-close regression exists; exit/stop hedge metadata implemented.
   - Funding carry dual-leg regression exists.
   - Replay terminal liquidation regression tests exist.
6. **Pairs close sizing gap** (P2): Exit/stop order size is still driven by signal sizing rather than current ledger position. Position-aware close sizing needs a separate design and implementation PR.
7. **ADR-0005 replay validation gates**: Gates 1-4 are implemented and ADR-0005 is Accepted. Gate 1 terminal position check is implemented via `validation["terminal_positions_closed"]`; PR13 added Gate 2 fill-rate warning, Gate 3 data coverage, and Gate 4 funding coverage.

## Do Not Touch (without explicit issue + user approval)

- `src/okx_quant/strategies/` — all strategy implementations
- `src/okx_quant/risk/` — risk guard, drawdown tracker, circuit breaker
- `src/okx_quant/portfolio/` — sizing, position ledger
- `src/okx_quant/execution/broker.py` — SimBroker and execution handler
- `config/risk.yaml` — risk limits
- Any file not listed in the current issue's permitted scope

## Next Steps (in order)

1. **[PR14A]** Design: shadow mode parity plan — `docs/shadow_mode_parity_plan.md`
2. **[PR14B]** Implementation: shadow mode SimBroker vs OKX demo gap fix
3. **[P2]** Design position-aware close sizing for exit/stop flows

## Documentation Cleanup Next Step

After PR4 is merged, classify existing Markdown files with lifecycle metadata in a dedicated docs-only cleanup PR. Do not change strategy assumptions or implementation behavior during that cleanup.

## Open Questions

- Should `AI_WORKFLOW.md` content eventually be merged back into `ai_collaboration.md`, or kept separate permanently?
- Which commit is the last confirmed clean state for integration tests (requires DB)?
- Is `config/risk.yaml` the authoritative risk limit file or is there per-strategy risk config in `strategies.yaml`?
